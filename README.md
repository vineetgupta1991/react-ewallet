# React-eWallet

A simple React ewallet admin app that controls the account and wallet for customers.


## Getting started

- Run the eWallet spring boot application locally. The project should start in http:localhost:8080/
- Run `npm install` then `npm start` command in your terminal.
- The project will start in http://localhost:3000 and UI page will pop-up.
- That's all!

## .env.local

In this file, I configured the URL of eWallet api spring boot project. Whichever the port you are using to run spring boot project, please configure this file accordingly.

```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'
```
